# PyCOMPSs implementation of Probabilistic Tsunami Forecast (PTF) 

Licence: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0  

PTF explicitly treats data- and forecast-uncertainties, enabling alert level definitions according to any predefined level of conservatism, which is connected to the average balance of missed-vs-false-alarms.  

The PyCOMPSs PTF workflow was developed under the eFlows4HPC project (https://eflows4hpc.eu/) funded by the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant
agreement No 955558.
